% WHATA - Measuring water quality
% Nasa spaceapps challenge Stuttgart
% 2017

## Project goals

* Crowdsource water quality
* create a cheap electronic measurement device
* have a system to gather the data
* display measurements on a map
    * integrate existing data layers

---

## Hardware

### Board
* ESP
    * 8 GPIOs (sensor binding)
        * -> max 8 signals
        * -> 8 ground circuts needed
    * Wifi
    * USB for power
        * waterproof? no
* Battery
    * 8 ground circuts for the sensors
    * 5V
    * 400-500 mA with all sensors

---

### Physical design (optional today)

* all possible sensors
    * [trinkwasser](http://www.bodensee-wasserversorgung.de/fileadmin/PDF/Jahresmittelwerte_2016_V08.pdf)
* maybe sensoric plugable
    * modularity
    * [IP67 waterproof jacks](http://www.molex.com/molex/products/family?key=splash_proof&channel=products&chanName=family&pageTitle=Introduction&utm_source=dpb&utm_medium=lit&utm_campaign=general)
        * can dive for a limited time
* 2 parts: waterproof space, sensor space

---

## Modular backend

* API to accumulate data
* modular system
* *providers* are abstractions of data sources
    * every data source is represented as a provider
    * defined API
    * send data to backend

* *backend* is a data storage component
    * get data from providers and store them in a database

---

## Frontend

* provides website, access and visualisations


---

## Measurements

* pH value
* TDS, conductivity
* visual transmissivity
